# Pure Functions in JavaScript 💧

This project demonstrates the concept of **pure vs impure functions** using simple and practical JavaScript examples.

A **pure function**:

- Always returns the same output for the same input.
- Has no side effects (doesn't mutate data or interact with external state).

---

## 📁 Structure

- `/pure`: Contains examples of pure functions.
- `/impure`: Contains examples of impure functions that break purity rules.
- `/run`: Entry point to run and log all examples.

---

## ▶️ Run Examples

You can run the examples using Node.js:

```bash
node run/index.js
```
